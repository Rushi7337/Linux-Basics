 Every file in Linux has the following attributes −
1)Owner permissions − The owner's permissions determine what actions the owner of the file can perform on the file.
2)Group permissions − The group's permissions determine what actions a user, who is a member of the group that a file belongs to, can perform on the file.
3)Other permissions − The permissions for others indicate what action all other users can perform on the file.
     Using ls -l command, it displays various information related to file permission 
     
1)Read-Grants the capability to read, i.e., view the contents of the file.
2)Write-Grants the capability to modify, or remove the content of the file.
3)ExecuteUser with execute permissions can run a file as a program.

Directory Access Modes:
Directory access modes are listed and organized in the same manner as any other file.
r = read permission
w = write permission
x = execute permission
- = no permission

Lets take an example
-rw-rw-r—
 the first '-' implies that we have selected a file
The first part of the code is 'rw-'. 
This suggests that the owner 'Home' can:
Read the file
Write or edit the file
Cannot execute the file.
The second part is 'rw-'. It for the user group 'Home' and group-members can:
Read the file
Write or edit the file
The third part is for the world which means any user. It says 'r--'. This means the user can only:
Read the file
